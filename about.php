<p>
Welcome to the University of Dr. Chuck! This site is the course catalog for my free, open, and online courses.
All of the materials here are openly licensed and designed to be useful whether you are a student, teacher,
or lifelong learner.
</p>

<p>
Some of these courses are also available on large learning platforms, while others are offered here using my
own open-source teaching platform called
<a href="https://www.tsugi.org/" target="_blank">Tsugi</a>.
</p>

<p>
One reason I build and run my own EdTech infrastructure is so I can explore ideas about teaching and learning
that are hard to try on mainstream platforms. I’m especially interested in hands-on learning, open assessment,
and tools that support large-scale, low-cost education. I hope that by building working examples, larger
platforms like Canvas, Coursera, and edX can learn from (and maybe borrow!) some of these ideas.
</p>

<p>
I also use these materials in my on-campus teaching as a faculty member at the University of Michigan School of
Information. However, the courses offered on this site are <em>not</em> University of Michigan courses and do not
carry University of Michigan credit.
</p>

<p>
If you find these courses helpful and would like to support this work, I would truly appreciate it.
Your support helps cover hosting costs, development time, and the creation of new courses and tools.
You can support me through
<a href="https://patreon.dr-chuck.com/" target="_blank">Patreon</a> or

</p>

<p>
You can also subscribe to my
<a href="https://youtube.dr-chuck.com" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, where I post lectures and walkthroughs,
and use the “Thanks” feature on a video if you’d like to leave a small tip. Every bit of support helps keep the
University of Dr. Chuck running and growing.
