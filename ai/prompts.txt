lets start fresh with a new course C programming for everybody. Make it fresh and different. 
Note when I upload lessons.json (the content) that there is nod toward Python as rosetta stone
with two languages and it ends with implementing Pytho objects in C.  This python-c-python
is a small aspect of the course - by and large this is a C course for python programmers.
In terms of graphic layout,  Ultra-wide horizontal catalog strip
Extremely short vertical height
All content confined to a narrow central horizontal band
Empty space above and below
No centered focal point
I will crop to 1000x300 px after downloading
feel free to place letterbox above and below
